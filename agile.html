  <h3>What is Agile?</h3>
  <p>
    Agile is a mindset and a set of principles to build software in small, frequent increments with strong collaboration and rapid feedback. It focuses on adaptability, quality, and customer involvement.
  </p>

  <h3>Why is Agile Important?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Responds quickly to customer feedback</li>
    <li>Helps teams adapt to changing business needs</li>
    <li>Increases transparency and visibility of work</li>
    <li>Reduces risk by delivering software faster in small increments</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The 12 Principles of Agile</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery</li>
    <li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development</li>
    <li>Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)</li>
    <li>Close daily collaboration between business people and developers</li>
    <li>Build projects around motivated individuals</li>
    <li>Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication</li>
    <li>Working software is the primary measure of progress</li>
    <li>Sustainable development pace is maintained indefinitely</li>
    <li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design</li>
    <li>Simplicity is essential</li>
    <li>Self-organizing teams produce the best results</li>
    <li>Regularly reflect and adjust behavior to become more effective</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Agile Manifesto</h4>
  <p>The Agile Manifesto emphasizes 4 values:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
    <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
    <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
    <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It also lists 12 principles that guide Agile teams toward quality, delivery, and adaptability.</p>

  <h4>Waterfall vs. Agile</h4>
  <p>Waterfall is linear and sequential, suitable for fixed-scope projects. Agile is iterative and incremental, ideal for projects needing flexibility. Agile promotes frequent reassessments and adaptations.</p>

  <h4>Benefits of Agile</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Faster delivery of value</li>
    <li>Improved product quality</li>
    <li>Greater transparency</li>
    <li>Customer satisfaction through early feedback</li>
    <li>Better team collaboration and motivation</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Agile Terminology</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Epic: A large body of work that can be broken down into stories</li>
    <li>User Story: A requirement told from the user's perspective</li>
    <li>Backlog: A prioritized list of work</li>
    <li>Sprint: A time-boxed development cycle</li>
    <li>Increment: A potentially shippable product piece</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Agile Frameworks Overview</h3>
  <p>Scrum: A widely used Agile framework with fixed-length iterations (sprints), well-defined roles, and ceremonies.<br>
     Kanban: Visual task management that limits work-in-progress and focuses on flow.<br>
     XP (Extreme Programming): Emphasizes technical excellence through pair programming, test-first development.<br>
     Lean: Derived from manufacturing, focuses on waste reduction and continuous flow.<br>
     SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework): A structured approach to scale Agile across large enterprises.</p>

  <h3>Agile Roles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Scrum Master: Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and shields the team from distractions.</li>
    <li>Product Owner: Owns the product backlog and ensures the right work is being prioritized for value delivery.</li>
    <li>Development Team: Cross-functional professionals who deliver increments of work.</li>
    <li>Stakeholders: Internal or external individuals invested in the outcome of the product.</li>
    <li>Agile Coach: Guides teams and organizations in their Agile adoption and practices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Intermediate Agile Topics</h2>
  <h3>Scrum Deep Dive</h3>
  <p>Scrum emphasizes short iterations called sprints. Events include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sprint Planning: Team selects work for the sprint based on priorities.</li>
    <li>Daily Standup: Short daily meeting to align on progress and obstacles.</li>
    <li>Sprint Review: Team demonstrates what was built during the sprint.</li>

  <h3>Agile Estimation & Planning</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Story Points: Relative size/effort of a user story, typically based on Fibonacci (1,2,3,5,...).</li>

  <h3>What is Scrum?</h3>
  <p>
    Scrum is an Agile framework using short iterations (sprints) to deliver working software. It defines clear roles, ceremonies, and artifacts to help teams stay organized and collaborative.
  </p>

  <h3>Scrum Roles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Scrum Master: Facilitates the process, removes blockers, and mentors the team on Scrum practices.</li>
    <li>Product Owner: Defines priorities and manages the product backlog.</li>
    <li>Development Team: Builds and tests the product increment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Scrum Ceremonies Explained with Examples</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Daily Stand-Up: 
      15-minute daily meeting where team members answer:
      <ul>
        <li>What did I do yesterday?</li>
        <li>What will I do today?</li>
        <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
      </ul>
      <em>Example:</em> “Yesterday I fixed login issue; today I’ll work on checkout tests; no blockers.”
    </li>
    <li>
      Sprint Planning: 
      Define what stories will be delivered in the next sprint.
      <br/>
      <em>Example:</em> Selecting 5 user stories from the backlog and breaking them into tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Backlog Refinement: 
      Ongoing session to clarify and estimate backlog items.
      <br/>
      <em>Example:</em> Splitting a big story about “Payment Gateway” into 3 smaller stories.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sprint Review: 
      Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders.
      <br/>
      <em>Example:</em> Showing a working demo of the new checkout flow to the product owner.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sprint Retrospective: 
      Discuss what went well, what didn’t, and how to improve.
      <br/>
      <em>Example:</em> Team agrees that code review delays should be improved next sprint.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Scrum Master Daily Role in Detail</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Facilitate the daily stand-up and keep it focused</li>
    <li>Support sprint planning and help clarify priorities</li>
    <li>Coordinate backlog refinement meetings with the Product Owner</li>
    <li>Protect the team from outside interruptions</li>
    <li>Track sprint metrics and help remove blockers</li>
    <li>Coach team members on Agile practices</li>
    <li>Organize sprint reviews and retrospectives</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Other Agile Frameworks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Kanban: Continuous flow, WIP limits, visual boards</li>
    <li>SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework): Scaling Agile to enterprise teams</li>
    <li>Extreme Programming (XP): Technical best practices for rapid software delivery</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Pro Tips for Beginners</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Participate fully in all ceremonies</li>
    <li>Don’t be afraid to ask questions</li>
    <li>Keep user stories small, testable, and clear</li>
    <li>Remember: Scrum is about teamwork, not just a checklist</li>
    <li>Make retrospectives honest and constructive</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Using Scrum as a status update rather than collaboration</li>
    <li>Ignoring the product backlog until sprint planning day</li>
    <li>Having unclear acceptance criteria for stories</li>
    <li>Skipping retrospectives and reviews</li>
    <li>Letting daily stand-ups run too long</li>
  </ul>
